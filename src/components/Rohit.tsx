      <p>In March 2005, Rohit made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in Deodhar Trophy. In the same tournament, Sharma scored an unbeaten inning of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at Udaipur. This gave Sharma an opportunity to represent India A at Abu Dhabi against Australia. Sharma was also named in the 30 man list for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament but failed to make the squad.


Sharma made his India A debut against New Zealand A in a first-class match at Darwin in July 2006. Months later, Rohit made his Ranji Trophy debut for his Mumbai in the 2006–07 season and was a part of the victorious Mumbai team. Sharma has been a part of Mumbai's Ranji Trophy team for his entire domestic career. Rohit was appointed team captain ahead of Mumbai for the 2013–14 season after the retirement of Ajith Agarkar.</p>
